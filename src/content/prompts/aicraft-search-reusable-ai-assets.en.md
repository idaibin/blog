Use this prompt to search for reusable AI assets that can become blog prompt entries, skills, workflows, or references.

## Prompt

任务名称：
Search reusable AI assets

执行时间：
[按需填写，例如每天 23:30]

时区：
Asia/Shanghai

任务类型：
定时搜索 / 可复用 AI 资产收集 / Prompt 与 Skill 沉淀

## Prompt Text

Search for reusable AI assets relevant to my blog's Prompts and Skills sections.

Inputs:

- Blog URL or local path: [provide URL/path]
- Current Prompts index: [provide index or say "not available"]
- Current Skills index: [provide index or say "not available"]
- Target audience: [developers / researchers / personal workflow / public readers]

If the blog or current asset index is not available, say so and search for generally reusable assets that can be adapted later. Do not invent the current blog structure.

Focus on:

- task-specific prompts
- reusable prompt templates
- system prompts
- tool orchestration patterns
- function calling patterns
- MCP integrations
- agent skills
- reusable task modules
- memory and context strategies
- evaluation patterns
- capability packaging for real workflows

Prioritize material with:

- clear task boundaries
- clear interfaces
- strong structure
- practical constraints
- implementation details
- evidence of real-world use
- reusable design patterns

For each useful asset, summarize:

- what it is
- which scenario it fits
- whether it should become a prompt, skill, workflow, or reference
- suggested inputs and outputs
- how it should be adapted
- how it fits into larger systems

## Requirements

- Write in English.
- Be concise, direct, and high-signal.
- Focus on reusable assets rather than generic AI tips or prompt collections.
- Highlight what should become a durable template or capability module.
- Prefer practical workflow value over novelty.
